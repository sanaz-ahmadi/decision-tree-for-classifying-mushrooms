<ul>
  <li>Implemented a decision tree from scratch and applied it to the task of classifying whether a mushroom is edible or poisonous based on its physical attributes.</li>
  <li>Used a dataset consisting of 10 examples, each with three features, and encoded them.</li>
  <li>Implemented entropy, splitting the dataset, computing information gain functions to generate a decision tree, and visualization functions to illustrate the splits in the decision tree.</li>
</ul>

### steps followed by the code:
<li> 1- Dataset --> One hot encoded dataset </li>
  <li> 2- Decision Tree Refresher
    <ol>
      <li>Calculate entropy</li>
      <li>Split dataset</li>
      <li>Calculate information gain</li>
      <li>Get best split</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
<li>3- Building the tree</li>
